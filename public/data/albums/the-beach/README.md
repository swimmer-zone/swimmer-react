# The Beach

I started creating music when I was about 12 years old, somehow I came up with the name Yupsie and I kept using that
name for quite a while. I started with FastTracker and later on I started using Propellerhead\'s Reason. Nowadays I use
Ableton. Recently I decided to change my name to Swimmer and these are the tracks I actually created with my new alias.
There are many more to come, so check back regularly!
