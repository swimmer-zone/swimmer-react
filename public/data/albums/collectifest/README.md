# Collectifest

We organised a festival for a small group of people to be able to show our talents. I created a set of some of my
favorite tracks, where it was a necessity to be able to control it while on stage. I plan to make more of them in the
future, using more recent tracks or maybe more like some sort of soundscape. I hope you enjoy it!
