# Fantastic Contraption

Marc pointed me to a new game, namely: Fantastic Contraption. You can find it on [http://www.fantasticcontraption.com/original/](http://www.fantasticcontraption.com/original/). You need some engineering skills with this game. A short explanation: In the toolbar you can find some materials, like wheels rotating clockwise and wheels rotating anti-clockwise. Also some parts to connect other parts. The game is self-explanatory, some things you can only find out by playing. The meaning of the game is to move the red block(s) to the light red area. The light blue area marks where the construction can be built. If you finish a level, you can find a link with solutions of other players, you can find a lot of nice contraptions here. If you make an account, you can save your contraptions too.

It's a pretty old game, so it still requires Flash. Another Flash game is [a variation on Super Mario](https://www.minijuegos.com/juegos/jugar.php?id=4294). Normally, you are Mario of course, but in this game you are the bullet and you have to kill Mario and the mushrooms. Jezzball is a nice Flash game too.

I'd like to point out some games that don't require Flash as well (nerd alert):

* [Z-Type](https://zty.pe)
* [Font Memory](https://betterwebtype.com/font-memory-game-hard)
* [Mini Mr. Driller](https://robowhale.com/html5/mr-driller/)
* [Is This Prime?](https://isthisprime.com/game/)
* [Pure CSS Stack](https://codepen.io/finnhvman/full/xJRMJp/)

Have fun!
