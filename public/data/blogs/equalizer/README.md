# Equalizer

When I was about 12 years old, I saved money to buy the first parts of my stereo. Throughout the years, some components were added, but I always wanted an equalizer with a graphical interface, with lights going up and down. It wasn't in the stores anymore, so I searched the internet for a second hand equalizer. Unfortunately, it guess only supports one signal, I don't have the user manual. This really doesn't matter, because now I can see the lights moving :). Of course I can connect the most important signal.

It's like the salesman read this, because he sent the user manual afterwards, now I can discover all details. Thanks!

This equalizer deserves a casing of course, so a week ago I began with an audio cabinet for my stereo system, built from MDF. I planned to give it a massive appeal and so the sides and the top are 6 centimetres thick, consisting of two plates of MDF. The space in between I've used to put some sockets for electricity and for speaker cables. I don't have a worklog or pictures, but if it's finished, I'll put some pictures on my website. I also plan to make a case for my PC, but I don't know when I'll start with that. I have some inspiration and some sketches in 3D Studio Max. I will put those online when I'll start. The tools I still need are a circular saw and a standard for my drill.
