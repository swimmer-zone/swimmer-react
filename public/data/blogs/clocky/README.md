# Clocky

Found another nice gadget, I've seen it before, but I decided to add it to my website. It's a soft, cuddly clock. That's necessary, because it's a clock for people who don't wake up well. If the alarm goes off, it's hiding itself somewhere when you press the snooze button, so you'll never know where it's going to be.

This would be ideal for me, at this moment I have three alarm clocks. One is standing next to my bed, so I'll wake up for a bit. But then the alarm clock at the other side of the room goes off, so I have to get out of my bed to put it off. This mostly works twice, before it becomes a routine and I can put it off while walking in my sleep. The third one is my phone, next to my pillow.

I subscribed to [website](https://clocky.com), because it isn't for sale yet. I'll get a message when the shipping starts.

## Other gadgets

Below a summary of some gadgets I found on ThinkGeek, I don't know if they're available in the Netherlands. I guess we won't have to wait long when they aren't.

* Spy coins: Coins with a hidden pocket, you can put something in there, like a micro SD card. These   are dollar coins, maybe they'll be available in Euro coins too.
* Vibe headphones: Ear plugs that you don't have to put in your ear, you can clamp them to your ear shell. Frequencies are transfered through your skull. It sounds amazingly clear and you can hear everything around you, so you can have a conversation while listening to music.
* No Place Like 127.0.0.1 doormat: Only for IT guys! :)
* Hidden Bookshelf: Bookshelf, ingeniously designed so that books appear to be floating on the wall.
* Cool Shooters: Handy shooters for parties, you can create an unlimited number of them and when they fall on the ground, they'll just melt, so no broken glass.
