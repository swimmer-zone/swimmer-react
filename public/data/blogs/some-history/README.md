# Some history

I decided to create some life here writing some stories about gadgets that I'm interested in, maybe I will buy some, but most of them are more interesting to read about. Some of them I really don't need and some of them are just prototypes.

First off, an [OLED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED) keyboard, from a designer (Artemis Lebedev) from Russia. In june 2005 they released a prototype. Right now it's [actually on the market](https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/maximus/). Every key on the keyboard is an actual tiny OLED screen, on which can be displayed the desired data. Normally this would be a normal keyboard, but they'll change in images of shortcuts, when working in Photoshop, for example. The keys lighting up in the dark is also a nice feature.

My website is online since july 2005 and now it's November 29th, 2006 and the fourth version is now live. The first version was made in Flash with a widescreen layout. Back then I didn't know anything about PHP.

The second version was also made with Flash, but was never published. At that moment I began to gain some knowledge about PHP with making a website for a gaming clan and a swimming club.

With the widescreen version, a lot of screen estate was lost. If the content is small, this is no big deal, but after writing some blogs and adding some functionality, it was quite a restriction, so I began with the third version of my website. I got inspired by Web 2.0, which gained popularity back then. Not only because it looked cool, but it also gave a great overview. Semantic HTML became more and more important. Before I used tables, but now I started using `<div>`s, which could be positioned using CSS. Tables were only for tabular data, in which rows and columns share some sort of relationship.

That was "going with the flow" and my website became less personal, so I started with the fourth version, again with some sort of widescreen effect. I only had to edit the index page and the CSS file and had to do some cleaning. The code was like spaghetti and I only used a class to handle the database connection, having its own error reporting mechanism. I got an e-mail when something went wrong, so I didn't have to display that on the website. From there I went on writing more classes and tried to do some object oriented programming. With the experience I gained, the website is now functional using 13 classes. Most of them I will be able to re-use in other websites.

I've added something new, namely the avatars have a nice mirror and tile effect. I'm definitely going to use this gimmick some more: [https://www.netzgesta.de/cvi/](https://www.netzgesta.de/cvi/)

Also I'm halfway translating for a German version, mainly as an exercise. But also to give the .eu domain a purpose. I have no idea if I'm doing well and what the second half will bring, so I could use some support.

It's been a while, but with this version I finally got 10.000 visitors!
