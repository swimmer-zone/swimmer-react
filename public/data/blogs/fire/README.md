# Fire

A while ago we had a fire in our home. Flames in a kettle and no one in the neighbourhood to notice it, so the fire department had to come. The kitchen and bathroom were totally useless, so there was no gas or electricity. Of course, internet was down too. We had to sleep somewhere else, which was quite an experience, because it were total strangers to me (relatives of a roommate), 20 kilometres south of Venlo. I had to go this distance quite a few times, using the train or a bicycle. Of course I'm very thankful to these people for the possibility to stay there for one and a half month. Same goes for my mother and the family where she resides right now. I got to spend some time there, when I didn't have to go to work.

Halfway through december, I went back to my own room, the kitchen and bathroom weren't finished yet, but electricity was back. There wasn't any hot water yet, but I could make that myself. Now the whole bathroom is renovated, as well as the kitchen with a whole new block. But no gas yet, so we have to be creative with dinner.

Ultimately, it was worth the wait, because it now looks a lot better than before.
