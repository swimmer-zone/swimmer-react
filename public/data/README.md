## Hey guys, I'm Swimmer

I'm phlegmatic and I'm a Scorpio, both of which relate to water. Above all I like to swim, floating far and away... in the water... in the music... and on many other journeys. With my music I like to create such journeys for others to join me, that's why I call myself Swimmer. My music is mostly ambient, dub and techno, but I'm trying to infuse some ethnic influences and even some psytrance tryouts.

I'm a minimalist; throughout the years everything has shrunk, including my website. I'm hosting my tracks myself again, after some issues with the SoundCloud API. You can still find my music there though. The other half are blog posts, my portfolio and a couple of my favorite resources. Please use the social media buttons to contact me about my music, blogs or any web-related topic. Of course you could also e-mail me on [info@swimmer.zone](mailto:info@swimmer.zone).
